## About the project
This project aims to give new meaning to old photographs that have been stored for a long time and are no longer valued. The idea comes from an attempt to reduce the pain and loss that people make us and that many times, the only way to see them again is through a photograph. After a long time, we go back to the past and remember these photographs and the importance of it. So the function of the project is to retrograph, that is, to capture a new photo of that photo, trying to look for new details and meanings that had not been observed before. From it, collage is one of the ways to create something different and that can be important to oneself.
